# Icebreaking Game App

## Overview
This app is designed to facilitate an ice-breaking session for the juniors of our batch. It features two main screens: one for the game controller (admin) and another for the participants.

## How It Works

### Admin Screen
The admin screen has three options:
1. **Login**: Displays a login page for users to enter their personal details and provide a single question with three different answers.
2. **Start**: After setting up, the admin can start the game, prompting users to a new screen where they will see a question from a random person and must answer it using the three answers they provided earlier. This encourages participants to interact and meet new people.
3. **End**: Displays the scoreboard to all participants.

### Participant Screen
- **Login Page**: Users enter their personal details and provide a question with three answers.
- **Game Screen**: Users are shown a question from a random person and must find the right answer by interacting with others.
- **Scoreboard**: Displays the scores at the end of the game.

## UI/UX Design
To make the UX memorable and fun:
- Use vibrant and engaging colors.
- Incorporate playful animations and transitions.
- Ensure the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Include humorous and light-hearted elements to keep the atmosphere fun.
